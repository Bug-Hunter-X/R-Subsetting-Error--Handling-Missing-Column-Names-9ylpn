```R
# This code attempts to subset a data frame using a character vector, but it fails if any of the values in the character vector are not present as column names.

df <- data.frame(A = 1:3, B = 4:6, C = 7:9)
cols_to_select <- c("A", "D", "C")
subset_df <- df[, cols_to_select]

# This will result in an error because "D" is not a column name.
```
